- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Robert.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm a beginner software developer with 10 years of experience in industrial engineering. This year I completed an intensive 445h programming course focused on working as a Junior Python Developer. However, my programming experience started much earlier: in elementary school I did some coding in QBasic, then in high school I tried basics of C++, later at university I learned basics of Turbo Pascal. In my current job I also code a little when I design parametric 3D models - I use VBA / Visual Studio in Autodesk Inventor.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently working individually on my private projects, for example https://totaltop.herokuapp.com
